# 25 + 5 Clock

## Summary
This app was created using the create-react-app tool. Has both eslint and prettier as dev-dependencies and uses the airbnb style guide for linting.

It's one of the five freeCodeCamp's Front End projects using libraries and frameworks.
This app is a productivity clock, that controls your work/break flow.

## Install and Run
1. Clone down this repository. You will need `node` and `npm` installed globally on your computer.
2. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the app.
4. Or visit the website: [25 + 5 Clock](https://gusvianadev.github.io/fcc-break-clock/)

## Special Dependencies
- None, just plain React.js with styled-components for styling

## What can this do?
This app is divided in two stages: session and break. You can set a session time, and a break time. The timer always starts at session. When it reaches 00:00, it turns into break time, then when it reaches 00:00 again, it turns into session again, and so on. It also has a reset button, and a beeping sound when the clock reaches 00:00.
